HLS 由 Apple 为 Apple 产品开发，但现在已广泛用于许多设备。

# HTTP Live Streaming

Send live and on‐demand audio and video to iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, Apple TV, and PC with HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) technology from Apple. Using the same protocol that powers the web, HLS lets you deploy content using ordinary web servers and content delivery networks. HLS is designed for reliability and dynamically adapts to network conditions by optimizing playback for the available speed of wired and wireless connections.
